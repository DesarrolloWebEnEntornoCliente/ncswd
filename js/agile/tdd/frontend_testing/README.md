# Testing in the Front-End #

## Description ##

Very simple example application to show how to test in the front-end:

* Manually
* Using CasperJS
* Using Karma
* Using Selenium and WebdriverIO

## Setup ##

Install dependencies:

```bash
$ npm install
```

Testing can be done manually:

```bash
$ npm run manual_test
```

But this is quite boring and error prone.

So, it is better to test it using CasperJS. CasperJS launches your
tests against a headless browser like phantomjs or slimerjs:

```bash
$ npm run casperjs_test
```

But what if I want to test against several browsers with or without GUI?
Karma comes to the rescue. Once launcheá¸‘, Karma watches for changes in your
application now an relaunches it in different browsers whenever you
modify it.

```bash
$ npm run karma_test
```

If you want to run Chromium instead of Chrome then you'll have to redefine
the following environment variable:

```bash
$ export CHROME_BIN=/paht/to/your/chromium_browser
```

Another way to test against multiple browsers is using WebdriverIO [3] and
Selenium [4]:

```bash
$ npm run wdio_test
```

A task runner like grunt [5] or a package like npm-watch [6] can be used
to relaunch tests when anything changes (Karma does this for you)

Some testing stacks like chimp [7] are built on top of these tools.

Enjoy testing!
